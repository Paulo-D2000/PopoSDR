### C/C++ Based SDR library with multithreaded pipelined DSP blocks

#### Available Blocks:
###### Sources:
- Network Source (UDP or TCP | Server or Client) :white_check_mark:
###### Sinks:
- Terminal Sink (F32 or CF32) :white_check_mark:
###### Filters:
- FIR Filter (Decimating or Interpolating) :white_check_mark:
- Polyphase FIR (Decimating or Interpolating) :white_check_mark: - "Faster" Polyphase implementation useful for resampling.
- FIR Taps Generator (Gaussian, Lowpass, Root Raised Cosine) :white_check_mark:
- CIC Filter (Decimating or Interpolating) :warning:
###### General:
- AGC (Automatic Gain Control) :white_check_mark:
- FM Modulator :white_check_mark:
- FM Demodulator (Differentiate & Delay) :warning:
- Constellation Mapper (Converts Bits to Symbols) :white_check_mark:
- Constellation Demapper (Converts Symbols to Bits) :white_check_mark:
###### Synchronizers:
- Carrier Recovery (Decision-Directed, ML) :white_check_mark:
- Timing PLL (Decision-Directed Timing Recovery) :warning:
###### Utils:
- Wave File Writing (.wav) for debugging tests


Some blocks are [EXPERIMENTAL] and marked with the :warning: this means they have some strange behaivour in some cases or just haven't been tested enough.

#### Modems (STILL IN DEV)
- Afsk Modulator (BELL 202 Like 1200Bd FSK Modulator)

- Gmsk Modulator (GMSK 4800bd Modulator)

#### Little Build Guide:
You will need a C++ Compiler with support for C++17 or greater, CMake and Make or Ninja...

1 - Clone the repo and cd into it:
```
git clone https://github.com/Paulo-D2000/PopoSDR.git
cd PopoSDR
```
2 - Now create a build folder and run cmake inside:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

3 - Then run make OR ninja:
```
make
```
```
ninja
```

4 - Try some examples :)

#### Examples (EXPERIMENTAL)
##### Simulation:
- **AFSK Test** :white_check_mark: - Generates AFSK Packets and demodulates them writing some debug Wave files.

- **GMSK Test** :white_check_mark: - Generates GMSK Packets with CCSDS Syncword and demodulates them printing the detected syncwords, also writes debugging Wave files.
- **Main Test** :warning: - This is just some general testing code, ignore it please.

##### Network sources:
- **WFM Mono UDP** :white_check_mark: - Reads S16-LE IQ samples at 1 MHz SampleRate from one local UDP client on port 1234 feeds them to one WFM (Wide FM Station) demodulates the Mono chanel and writes one 48KHz S16-LE audio stream on stdout.

- **GMSK Rx** :warning: - Reads S16-LE IQ samples at 1MHz SampleRate from one local TCP server on port 1234 feeds them to a 1200Bd GMSK BT=0.5 demodulator that searches for the `0x1ACFFC1D` Syncword and prints their data to stderr. It also outputs one S16LE 4800Hz stream on stdout for debugging.

- **QAM RX** :warning: - Reads S16-LE IQ samples at 48KHz SampleRate from one local TCP and feeds them to the experimental 16-QAM Demodulator outputting the synchronized IQ symbols via stdout as one 6000Hz IQ S16-LE stream... This is still on the testing phase!

#### Info: 
- S16-LE - 16 bit signed integer
- IQ - Quadrature signal, 2 channels, Real & Imaginary
- The TimingPLL Block has 2 variants, Real (F32) and Complex (CF32), the first one was inspired on DireWolf's AFSK PLL while the second one uses a Maximum Likelyhood (ML-TED) with a Polyphase FIR Bank Interpolator. The Interpolator can set to (MMSE) 'Minimum Mean Square Error' having 128 arms or to (PFB) 'Matched Polyphase FIR Bank' with a variable number of filter arms.
